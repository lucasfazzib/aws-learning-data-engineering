CLOUDFORMATION

-> AWS CLOUDFORMATION IS A SERVICE THAT HELPS YOU MODEL AND SET UP YOUR AMAZON WEB SERVICES RESOURCES SO THAT
YOU CAN SPEND LESS TIME MANAGING THOSE RESOURCES AND MORE TIME FOCUSING ON YOUR APPLICATIONS THAT RUN IN AWS.

-> YOU CREATE A TEMPLATE THAT DESCRIBES ALL THE AWS RESOURCES THAT YOU WANT ( EC2, RDS...), AND AWS CLOUDFORMATION TAKES CARE 
    OF PROVISIONING AND CONFIGURING THOSE RESOURCES FOR YOU.

-> YOU DONT NEED TO INDIVIDUALLY CREATE AND CONFIGURE AWS RESOURCES AND FIGURE OUT WHATS DEPENDET ON WHAT.

-> AWS CLOUDFORMATION HANDLES ALL OF THAT.


-> ELASTIC BEANSTALK AND CLOUDFORMATION ARE BOTH FREE SERVICE, HOWEVER THE RESOURCES THEY PROVISION (SUCH AS EC2 INSTANCES) ARE NOT FREE.

-> ELASTIC BEANSTALK IS LIMITED IN WHAT IT CAN PROVISION AND IS NOT PROGRAMMABLE.

-> CLOUDFORAMTION CAN PROVISION ALMOST ANY AWS SERVICE AND IS COMPLETELY PROGRAMMABLE.
