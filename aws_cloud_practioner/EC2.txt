ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD



EC2 
    -> WEB SERVER THAT PROVIDES RESIZABLE COMPUTE CAPACITY IN THE CLOUD
    VIRTUAL CAPACITY IN THE CLOUD

    -> ON DEMAND   
        -> PAY FIXED RATE BY THE HOUR OR BY THE SECOND
    -> RESERVED
        -> PROVIDES YOU WITHA  CAPACITY RESERVED, CONTRACT TERMS 1 TO 3 YEARS.
    -> SPOT
        -> STOP MARKET, PRICE MOVE AROUND ALL TIME
    -> DEDICATED
        -> REGULAR OR LICESING REQUIREMENTS.


    F - FPGA
    I - FOR IOPS
    G - GRAPHICS
    H - HIGH DISK TRHOUGHPUT
    T - CHEAP GENERAL PURPOSE ( T2 MICRO...)
    D- DENSITY
    R - RAM
    M - MAIN CHOICE FOR GENERAL PURPOSE
    C - FOR COMPUTE
    P - GRAPHICS(PICS)
    X - EXTREME MEMORY

EBS
    JUST THE VIRTUAL DISK IN THE CLOUD

    SSD
        GENERAL PURPOSE -> GP2 ( BALANCES PRICES AND PERFORMANCE FOR A VARIETY WORKLOADS)
        PROVSIONED IOPS SSD -> IO1  ( HIGHEST PERFORMANCE SSD VOLUME FOR LOW-LATENCY OR HIGH TROUGHPUT)

    MAGNETIC
        TRHOUGHPUT OPTIMIZED HDD -> ST1 (LOW COST HDD VOLUME DESIGNED FOR FREQUENTLY ACCESSED)
        COLD HDD -> SC1 ( LOWEST COST HDD VOLUME FOR LESS FREQUENTLY ACCESSED) FIEL SERVERS
        MAGNETIC - PREVIOUS GENERATION

LAB EC2

============================================


EC2 IS A COMPUTE BASED SERVICE. ITS NOT A SERVERLESS, ITS A VIRTUAL SERVER !
USE PRIVATE KEY TO CONNECT OT EC2
LINUX SERVERS -> PORT 22 (SSH)
WINDOWS SERVERS -> PORT 3389 (REMOTE DESKTOP PROTOCOL)
HTTP -> PORT 80
HTTPS -> PORT 443

SECURITY GROUP = SECURITY FIREWALL
TO LET EVERYTHING IN 0.0.0.0/0

TO LET JUST ONE IP IN X.X.X.X/32

SECURITY ARE VIRTUAL FIREWALLS IN THE CLOUD
YOU NEED TO OPEN PORTS IN ORDER TO USE THEM.
POPULAR PORTS ARE SSH 22, HTTP 80, HTTPS 443, RDP 3389

ALWAYS DESIGNED FOR FAILURE. HAVE ONE EC2 INSTANCE EACH AVAILABILITY ZONE.



You can interact with AWS in 3 ways:
    USING THE CONSOLE
    USING THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (GUI)
    USING SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KITS (SDKS)




ROLES ARE MUCH MORE SECURE THAN USING ACCESS KEY IDS AND SECRET ACCESS KEYS AND ARE EASIER TO MANAGE


YOU CAN APPLY ROLES TO EC2 INSTANCES AT ANY TIME.

ROLES ARE UNIVERSAL.
YOU DONT NEED TO SPECIFY WHAT REGION THEY ARE IN, SIMILAR TO USERS.


===============================================
==============================================

BUILD A WEB SERVER 
LAB

connect via putty

ec2-user
sudo su
yum update
yum install httpd -y
service https start
cd /var/www/html/
vi index.html
create a html simple page
put ipv4 address on browser.


=====================================================
IMPORTANT !!!!!!
====================================================
USE AN ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER !


    BOOTSTRAP SCRITPS TO INSTALL ALL AUTOMATICALLY WHEN PROVISIONING.

    APPLICATION LOAD BALANCERS
        -> GOOD FOR APPLICATIONS
        ->  CAUSE YOU CAN SEE INTO THE CODE AND MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS

    NETWORK LAOD BALANCERS
        -> EXTREME HIGH PERFORMANCE
        ->STATIC IP ADDRESS

    CLASSIC LOAD BALANCER
        -> KEEP IT CHEAP AND CHEERFULL


    LOAD BALANCERS COME IN 3 DIFFERENT FLAVOURS
        APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER
        NETWORK LOAD BALANCER
        CLASSIC LOAD BALANCER

    
    APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER
        LAYER 7 ( MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS)

    NETWORK LOAD BALANCERS - EXTREME PERFORMANCE/STATIC IP ADDRESSES

    CLASSIC LOAD BALANCER
        TESTE, DEV, KEEP COST LOW
