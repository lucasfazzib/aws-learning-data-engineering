KNOW THE 6 ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD
    -> TRADE CAPITAL EXPENSES FOR VARIABLE EXPENSES
    -> BENEFIT FROM MASSIVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE
    -> STOP GUESSING ABOUT CAPACITY
    -> INCREASE SPEED AND AGILITY
    -> STOP SPENDING MONEY RUNNING AND MAINTANING DATA CENTERS
    -> GO GLOBAL IN MINUTES

KNOW THE 4 TYPES OF CLOUD COMPUTING
    -> INFRASCTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE (IAAS)
    -> PLATFORM AS A SERVICE(PAAS) ELASTICBENSTALK
    -> SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SAAS)

KNOW THE 4 TYPES OF CLOUD COMPUTING DEVELOPMENT
    -> PUBLIC CLOUD (AWS, AZURE,GCP)
    -> HYBRID (MIXTURE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE)
    -> PRIVATE(OR ON PREMISE) - YOU MANAGE IT, IN YOUR DATACENTER, OPENSTACK OR VMWARE

UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A REGION, AN AVAILABILITY ZONE, AN A EDGE LOCATION
    -> REGION IS A PHYSICAL LOCATION IN THE WORLD WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO OR MORE AVAILABILITY ZONES
    -> AVAILABILITY ZONES IS ONE OR MORE DISCRETE DATA CENTERS, EACH WITH REDUNDANT POWER,
        NETOWRK AND CONNECTIVITY.
    -> EDGE LOCATIONS ARE ENDPOINTS FOR AWS WHICH ARE USED FOR CACHING CONTENT 
        - TIPICALLY CONSISTS OF:   
            -> CLOUDFRONT
            -> AMAZONS CONTENT DELIVERY NETWROK (CDN)

CHOOSING THE RIGHT AWS REGION?
    -> DATA SOVEREIGNTY LAWS
    -> LATENCY TO END USERS
    -> AWS SERVICES ( WHAT AWS SERVICES DO YOU NEED.)

UNDERSTAND DIFFERENTE SUPPORT PACKAGES
    -> BASIC (FREE)
    -> DEVELOPER ($29/MONTH)
    -> BUSINESS ($100/MONTH) - SCALES BASED ON USAGE
    -> ENTERPRISE ($15.000/MONTH) -SCALE BASED ON USAGE - TAM (TECHNICAL ACCOUNT MANAGER)

BILLING ALERTS/ BILLING ALARMS
    -> WILL ALERT YOU AUTOMATICALLY WHEN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF AWS SPEND HAS REACHED.

IAM 
    -> IDENTITY ACCESS MANAGEMENT
        -> IT IS GLOBAL
        -> YOU DONT NEED TO SPECIFY A REGION.
    
YOU CAN ACCESS AWS PLATFORM IN 3 WAYS
    -> CONSOLE
    -> PROGRAMMATICALLY
    -> SDKS

ROOT ACCOUNT IS THE EMAIL ADDRESS YOU USED TO SET UP YOUR AWS ACCOUNT, MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION.


GROUP IS A SIMPLY PLACE TO STORE YOURS USERS.

TO GET SRT THE PERMISSION IN A GROUP YOU NEED TO APLLY A POLICY TO THAT GROUP   
    -> THAT CONSISTS OF JAVASCRIPT BASED OBJECT

S3
    -> OBJECT-BEASED ( ALLOW UPLOAD FILES)
    -> FILES CAN BE 0 TO 5TB
    -> UNLIMITED STORAGE
    -> FILES STORED IN BUCKETS
    -> S3 IS A UNIVERSAL NAMESPACE (NAMES MUST BE UNIQUE GLOBALLY)
    -> NOT SUITABLE TO INSTALL OPERATING SYSTEM
    -> RETURN HTTPS STATUS
    -> KEY-VALUE
    -> READ AFTER WRITE CONSISTENCY FOR PUTS OF NEW OBJECTS
    -> EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY FOR OVERWRITE PUTS AND DELETES ( CAN TAKE SOME TIME TO PROPAGATE)
    -> WHEN YOU VIEW YOUR BUCKETS YOU VIEW THEM GLOABALLY BUT YOU CAN HAVE BUCKETS INDIVUDAL REGIONS.
    -> YOU CAN REPLICATE THE CONTENTS OF ONE BUCKET TO ANOTHER BUCKET IN ANOTHER REGION ( CROSS REGION REPLICATION)
    -> S3 TRANSFER ACCELERATION WITH EDGE LOCATIONS TO TRANSFER TO S3 ( INCREASE SPEED )
    -> TYPES:
        -> S3 STANDARD
            -> 99,9% AVAILABILITY
            -> 99,999999999% DURABILITY
            -> DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN THE LOSS OF 2 FACILITIES CONCUNRRENTLY

        -> S3 - IA (INFREQUENTLY ACCESSED)
            -> FOR DATA THAT IS ACCESSED LESS FREQUENTLY
            -> BUT REQUIRES RAPID ACCESS WHEN NEEDED.
            -> LOWER FEE THAN S3, BUT YOU ARE CHARGED A RETRIEVAL FEE

        -> S3 ONE ZONE - IA
            -> FOR WHEN YOU WANT A LOWER-COST OPTION FOR INFREQUENTLY-ACCESSED DATA
            -> BUT NOT REQUIRE THE MULTIPLE AZ DATA RESILLIENCE

        -> S3 - INTELLIGENT TIERING
            -> DESIGNED FOR OPTIMIZED COSTS BY AUTOMATICALLY MOVING DATA TO THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE ACCESS TIERING
            -> WITHOUT PERFORMANCE IMPACT OR OPERATIONAL OVERHEAD
            
        -> S3 - GLACIER
            -> SECURE, DURABLE AND LOW-COST SOTRAGE CLASS FOR DATA ARCHIVING
            -> RETRIEVAL TIMES CONFIGURABLE FROM MINUTES TO HOURS.

        -> S3 - GLACIER DEEP ARCHIVE
            -> LOWER-COST STORAGE CLASS WHERE A RETRIEVAL TIME OF 12 HOURS IS ACCEPTABLE


        -> YOU CAN USE BUCKET POLICIES TO MAKE EVERYTHING ON S3 PUBLIC.
        -> YOU CAN USE S3 TO HOST """"STATIC"""" WEBSITE (.HTML)
            -> WEBSITES THAT REQUIRE DATABASE CONNECTION SUCH AS WORDPRESS CANNOT BE HOSTED ON S3.
        
        -> S3 SCALES AUTOMATICALLY TO MEET YOUR DEMAND
        -> MANY ENTERPRISES WILL PUT STATIS WEBSITES ON S3 WHEN THEY THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE
             A LARGE NUMBER OF REQUETS (SUCH AS FOR A MOVIE PREVIEW)
        
        -> CLOUDFRONT  
            -> REQUEST FILE -> FIRST ACCESS -> DONWLOAD FROM S3 BUCKET -> ANOTHER USERS -> EDGE LOCATIONS
            -> EDGE LOCATION: THIS IS THE LOCATION WHERE CONTENT WILL BE CACHED
            -> ORIGIN: THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF ALL FILES THAT THE CDN WILL DISTRIBUTE.
            -> DISTRIBUITION: 
                -> NAME GIVEN THE CDN WHICH CONSISTS OF A COLLECTION OF EDGE LOCATIONS
                    -> WEB DISTRIBUITION:
                        -> TYPICALLY USED FOR WEBSITES
                    -> RTMP
                        -> USED FOR MEDIA STREAMING
        
            -> EDGE LOCATIONS ARE NOT JUST READ ONLY ( YOU CAN WRITE TO THEM)
            -> OBJECTS ARE CACHED FOR THE LIFE OF TTL ( TIME TO LIVE)
            -> YOU CAN CLEAR CACHED OBJECTS, BUT WILL BE CHARGED

        -> EC2
            -> WEB SERVICE THAT PROVIDES RESIZABLE COMPUTE CAPACITY IN THE CLOUD.
            -> TYPES:
                -> ON DEMAND ( PAY PER HOUR OR BY SECOND)
                -> RESERVED (CAPACITY FO RESERVATION, OFFER SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT ON THE HOURLY CHARGE FOR AN INSTANCES)
                -> SPOT (ENABLE YOU TO BID WHATEVER PRICE YOU WANT FOR INSTANCE CAPACITY)
                -> DEDICATED HOSTS (PHYSICAL EC2 SERVER DEDICATED FOR YOUR USE.)

            -> IF THE SPOT INSTANCE IS TERMINATED BY AMAZON EC2, YOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED FOR A PARTIAL HOUR OF 
                USAGE. HOWEVER, IF YOU TERMINATE THE INSTANCE YOURSELF, YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR ANY HOUR
                    IN WHICH THE INSTANCE RAN.

            -> TO LET EVERYTHING IN 0.0.0.0/0
            -> ESPECIFIC IP IN X.X.X.X/32

        -> SECURITY GROUPS ARE VIRTUAL FIREWALL IN THE CLOUD  
            -> YOU NEED TO OPEN PORTS IN ORDER TO USE THEM
            ->POPULAR PORTS:
                -> SSH (22)
                -> RDP (3389)
                -> HTTP (80)
                -> HTTPS (443)

    -> ROLES ARE UNIVERSAL.
        -> YOU DONT NEED TO SPECIFY A REGION THEY ARE IN, SIMILAR TO USERS
    
    -> LOAD BALANCERS COME IN 3 DIFFERENTS FLAVOURS:
        -> APPLICATIONS LOAD BALANCERS
            -> LAYER 7 ( MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS)

        -> PROCESS COMPUTERS USE TO RESOLVE DOMAIN NAMES TO IP ADDRESS

    -> AMAZON DNS SERVICE IS CALLED ROUTE53
    
    -> ITS GLOBAL, SIMILAR TO IAM AND S3

    -> YOU CAN USE IT TO DIRECT TRAFFIC ALL AROUND THE WORLD

    -> USE TO REGISTER DOMAIN NAME


    -> ELASTICBEANSTALK
        -> QUICKLY DEPLOY AND MANAGE APPLICATIONS IN THE AWS CLOUD WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT
            THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT RUNS THOSE APPLICATIONS.

        -> YOU DONT NEED TO INDIVIDUALLY CREATE THE RESOURCES....
        -> CREATE FROM TEMPLATE...

    -> ELASTIC BEANSTALK AND CLOUDFORMATION ARE BOTH FREE SERVICES, BUT THE RESOURCES THEY PROVISION ARE NOT FREE.

    -> ELASTIC BEANSTALK IS LIMITED IN WHAT IT CAN PROVISION AND IS NOT PROGRAMMABLE.
    -> CLOUDFORMATION CAN PROVISON ALMOST ANY AWS SERVICE AND IS COMPLETELY PROGRAMMABLE.
