Cloud Computing & AWS

What is cloud Computing 
    - Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, database, storage, applications,
    and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the itnernet with pay-as-you-go-pricing.
    
    - Think of it as simply renting someone elses computer.

6 ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD Computing

    1) TRADE CAPITAL EXPENSE FOR VARIABLE EXPENSE   
        -> You can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you use.

    2) BENEFIT FROM MASSIVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE
        -> You will never have the same purchasing power as Amazon.They literally build their own servers.

    3) STOP GUESSING ABOUT CAPACITY
        -> You will probally either to buy too much or too little.
        -> If you buy too much, you've wasted money and if you buy too little you will have
        down time.
        -> Cloud can scale with you business needs, with no long term contracts.

    4) INCREASE YOUR SPEED AND AGILITY
        -> The great think about cloud is that you can increase you speed and agility in moving into the 
        cloud.

    5) STOP SPENDING MONEY RUNNING AND MAINTAINING DATA CENTERS.
        -> Focus on what you are good at, not at managing infrastructure. Let someone else manage that 
        for you.

    6) GO GLOBAL IN MINUTES
        -> Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks.
        -> This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at 
        minimal cost.
    

3 different types of cloud computing
    -> INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE (IAAS)
        -> Basically is AWS.
        -> You manage the server wich can be physical or virtual, as well as the operating system.
        -> Usually the data center provider will have no access to your server.
        -> ex: EC2....

    -> PLATFORM AS A SERVICE (PASS)
        -> Someone else manages the underlying hardware and operating systems.
        -> You just focues on your applications.
        -> Someone else worries about security/patching, updates, maintenance.
        -> ex: ElasticBeanstalk, Lightsail....

    -> SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SAAS)
        -> Think of gmail.
        -> All you amnage is your inbox.
        -> Google take care of the data centers, servers, network...all you worry about is the software
        itselfand how to sue it.

3 TYPES OF CLOUD COMPUTING DEPLOYMENTS
    -> PUBLIC CLOUD
        -AWS
        -GCP
        -AZURE
    
    -> HYBRID
        -Misture of private and cloud
    
    -> PRIVATE (*ON-PREMISE)
        - You manage it, in your datacenter.
        - OPENSTACK, VMWARE, microsofts HyperV
