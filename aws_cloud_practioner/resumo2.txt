EDGES LOCATIONS
    ->  We got more edges locations than REGIONS
    ->  Edges locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content
    -> Typically it consists os CLOUDFRONT, AMAZON CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK (CDN)
    -> THEY ARE MANY MORE EDGE LOCATIONS THAN REGIONS.
    -> If someone in London needs to acces a file in s3 bucket that is located in New York, the first time
    that he access it, he will need to donwload the file, in the second time that someone in London
    need to access that same file that will be cached in EDGE LOCATION. That can be downloaded a lot quicker.
