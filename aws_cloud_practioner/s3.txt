    -> S3 STANDARD: 
        99,99% AVAILABILITY
        99,99% DURABILITY
        DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN THE LOSS OF 2 FACILITIES CONCUNRRENTLY
    
    -> S3 - IA
        INFREQUENTLY ACCESSED

        BUT NOT REQUIRE THE MULTIPLE AVAILABILITY ZONE DATA RESILIENCE

    -> S3 - INTELLIGENT TIERING
        DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE COSTS BY AUTOMATICALLY MOVING DATA TO THE MOST-COST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TIER
        WITHOUT PERFORMANCE IMPACT OR OPERATIONAL OVERHEAD

    -> S3 GLACIER
        SECURE, DURABLE, AND LOW COST STORAGE CLASS FOR DATA ARCHIVING
        RETRIEVAL TIME CONFIGURABLE FROM MINUTES TO HOURS

    -> S3 GLACIER DEEP ARCHIVE
        -> LOWER COST
        -> RETRIEVAL OF 12HOURS TO ACCEPT.

    
YOU ARE CHARGED FOR S3 IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS:
    -> STORAGE
    -> REQUESTS
    -> STORAGE MANAGEMETN PRICING
    -> DATA TRANSFER PRICING
    -> TRANSFER ACCELERATION
    -> CROSS REGION REPLICATION PRICING

    ALLOWS TO UPLOAD A Files
    FILES CAN BE FROM 0 byte TO 5tb

RESTRICTING BUCKET ACCESS
    -> BUCKET POLICIES : APPLIES ACCROSS THE WHOLE BUCKET
    -> OBJECT POLICIES : APPLIES TO INDIVIDUAL FILES
    -> IAM POLICIES : APPLIS TO USERS E GROUPS
